This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially within a component that renders before the layout is fully determined.  It can manifest as incorrect or inconsistent width and height values, leading to layout issues and unexpected behavior.  The problem often stems from attempting to access `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` too early in the component's lifecycle, before the layout has been calculated.
